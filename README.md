# n8n-nodes-Flowbot

Flowbot Community Nodes for n8n

## Overview

This package adds Flowbot integration to [n8n](https://n8n.io), the open-source automation platform.  
It lets you receive events from Flowbot and work with your support data (agents, tickets, etc.) directly inside n8n workflows — without writing custom HTTP requests every time.

With these nodes you can:
- Subscribe to Flowbot webhooks and trigger n8n instantly when something happens (new ticket, ticket update, etc.).
- Fetch agents / contacts from Flowbot.
- Create or update support tickets in Flowbot from any workflow.
- Pass Flowbot data forward to email, Slack, CRM (including Zoho CRM, Jira, Salesforce, HubSpot, etc.), and other business tools.

> Goal: make it easy for support / success teams to automate workflows around Flowbot without coding.

## Technical Documentation

### Integration Flow

This integration automates the creation and linking of a Flowbot tool with an agent for ticket creation and update.

#### How It Works

- **Create/Update Ticket:**  
  When you select "Create Ticket" or "Update Ticket" in n8n, you can press **Execute Step** to preview sample data fields.
  After specifying the agent list and tool name, pressing **Execute Step** again returns a structured JSON response with ticket details.

#### Authentication

- Users must enter credentials, including an API key, in the node’s credentials section.
- The API key is required to authorize communication with the Flowbot backend.
- Example header:
  ```
  X-API-KEY: <your-api-key>
  ```

#### Under the Hood

- **Webhook Subscription:**  
  When you subscribe via the trigger node, the backend creates a webhook subscription linking your Flowbot tool and webhook URL.
- **Event Delivery:**  
  When an agent is called during a workflow (e.g., incoming call or message), and a ticket is created or updated, the backend sends event data to your n8n workflow.
- **Verification:**  
  The webhook includes internal verification.  
  Only requests with the correct authentication header and required fields generated by Flowbot are accepted.

## Webhook Request/Response Examples

### Ticket Creation

**Request Example:**
```json
{
  "contact": "TestContact",
  "email_contact": "test@gmail.com",
  "subject": "Ticket created",
  "description": "Updated"
}
```

### Ticket Update

**Request Example:**
```json
{
  "ticket_number": "0425",
  "contact": "TestContact",
  "email_contact": "test@gmail.com",
  "subject": "Ticket updated",
  "description": "Updated"
}
```

### Headers for Verification

Flowbot webhooks require authentication headers.
Only requests with valid headers and payload structure are processed by the n8n node.

## Typical Use Cases

- Auto-create a Flowbot ticket from an inbound email or web form.
- Notify Slack/Telegram when a VIP ticket changes to `Escalated`.
- Auto-assign new tickets to the "on-duty" agent and log that to Google Sheets.
- Send conversation transcripts to CRM systems such as Zoho CRM, Jira, Salesforce, HubSpot, or to a data warehouse.
- Sync ticket updates with external project management tools (e.g., Jira) or customer databases (e.g., Zoho CRM).

## Requirements

To use these nodes you need:
1. **A Flowbot account
2. **API Key** generated in Flowbot.  
   The node will send this key in headers (for example: `X-API-KEY`) with every request.  
3. **Self-hosted n8n** or n8n instance that allows installing community nodes from npm.

Node.js 18+ / 20+ and a recent n8n version are typically required for community nodes.

## Installation

### Option 1: Install via n8n UI (self-hosted n8n)
1. Open your n8n instance.
2. Go to **Settings → Community Nodes**.
3. Add the package name:  
   `n8n-nodes-flowbot`
4. Confirm installation and restart if n8n asks.

### Option 2: Install manually with npm
If you run n8n from source / Docker with custom extensions:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/n8n
npm install n8n-nodes-Flowbot
```
